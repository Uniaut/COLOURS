# COLOURS
Game project for my 2nd semester assignment - midterm check.

* There is very difficult & shoddy way to draw Cube. do not try this at home.


# How to play?
Using Left & Right arow key to control cube.
When the ball hits the cube, the cube color and the ball color must be same.

Click the ball to play & replay.

There is bug that Gameover sound isn't played.
